# Schrodinger-Equation Simulation for Bachelor Thesis

This repository is made to document my code that was used for my thesis at the American University in Cairo.
The thesis aims to use IBM's QISKIT to simulate the Schrodinger Wave Equation in four different scenarios:
1. Free Particle
2. Eigenstate in an infinite well
3. A Gaussian wave packet with a momentum heading towards a step potential
4. A particle undergoing quantum tunneling

All these experiments are done through IBM's QASM simulator with 6 qubits. Plans to reduce the number of qubits to be able to simulate them with a real quantum computer is still underway.
